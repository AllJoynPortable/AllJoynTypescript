AllJoyn Typescript (AJ.TS)
==========================

What is AJ.TS project?
----------------------

AJ.TS is a lightweight AllJoyn protocol implementation made in TypeScript. We have selected TypeScript as our base implementation, as we believe that TypeScript is the most portable option. Our current implementation can run everywhere:
* in any browser, which means easy deploynment of AllJoyn to any mobile device
* as a part of Apache Cordova application
* as WinJS application
* in Node.JS, which means we can easy deploy AllJoyn services in the cloud, as well as on any IoT device running Node.JS - we are currently testing MTK MT7688 and Tessel 2 boards

What is the future?
