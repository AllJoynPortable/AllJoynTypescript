    <p class="header-sub">WebSocket --> Socket Proxy</p>
     
    AllJoyn TypeScript HTML implementation uses WebSocket to connect to AllJoyn. As AllJoyn Router currently doesn’t support WebSocket connection it’s necessary to use a proxy.
    One possibility is websockify which can be downloaded from here:<br />

    <br />
    Before starting AllJoyn TS HTML demo, you need to start websockify from command line as follows:<br />

    <br />
    After proxy is started, make sure you have correct settings in <b>Setup</b> menu.<br />
    <br/>

    Press <b>Test</b> button to connect. Your device should appear in AllJoyn Explorer as follows:
